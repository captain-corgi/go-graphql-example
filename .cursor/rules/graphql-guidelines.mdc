# GraphQL rules

- **Schema-first**: Edit `api/graphql/*.graphqls` and run `make generate-graphql` to update generated types and resolvers.
- **Resolvers**: Keep resolvers thin; delegate business logic to `internal/application` services.
- **Validation**: Use the resolver `validation.go` helpers and domain value objects for input validation.
- **Errors**: Map domain errors to GraphQL friendly error shapes in `interfaces/graphql/resolver/error_handler.go`.
- **Pagination**: Use cursor-based pagination already implemented; follow existing `users` schema patterns.

Refer to `examples/graphql/` for query/mutation examples.
