# Security practices

- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets to git. Use environment variables or secret stores; `configs/*` are for non-secret configuration only.
- **DB URLs**: Use `DATABASE_URL` env var in production; do not hardcode credentials in code or configs.
- **Migrations**: Review migration SQL carefully; use `make migrate-up` in CI gated environments.
- **Dependency checks**: Run `make security` in CI to catch vulnerable deps.
