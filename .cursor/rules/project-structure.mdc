# Project structure and responsibilities

- **Entry point**: `cmd/server/main.go` — application bootstrap and DI wiring.
- **GraphQL schema**: `api/graphql/*.graphqls` — schema-first; run `make generate-graphql` after edits.
- **Interfaces layer**: `internal/interfaces/` — GraphQL resolvers, HTTP server and middleware.
- **Application layer**: `internal/application/` — use-cases, DTOs, and service orchestration.
- **Domain layer**: `internal/domain/` — entities, value objects, domain services, and repositories interfaces.
- **Infrastructure layer**: `internal/infrastructure/` — DB connection, persistence implementations, logging, config.

When making changes, keep modifications within a single layer unless intentionally changing dependencies.
