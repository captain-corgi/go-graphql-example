# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the foundational GraphQL service for the go-graphql-example project. The service will establish the core architecture following Clean Architecture principles with Domain-Driven Design, providing a working GraphQL API with basic functionality, persistence layer, and proper separation of concerns. This implementation covers Phase 1-3 from the project roadmap, creating a production-ready foundation that can be extended with additional features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working GraphQL server with a basic schema, so that I can query and mutate data through a GraphQL endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL expose a GraphQL endpoint at `/query`
2. WHEN a client accesses `/playground` THEN the system SHALL serve GraphiQL playground for API exploration
3. WHEN a valid GraphQL query is sent THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted GraphQL responses
4. WHEN an invalid GraphQL query is sent THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages in GraphQL format
5. IF the server fails to start THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean domain model with proper separation of concerns, so that business logic is independent of frameworks and easily testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain entities are created THEN they SHALL be framework-agnostic and contain only business logic
2. WHEN repository interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL be placed in the domain layer
3. WHEN use cases are implemented THEN they SHALL orchestrate domain operations without framework dependencies
4. WHEN resolvers are implemented THEN they SHALL delegate to application services and remain thin
5. IF domain logic needs to be tested THEN it SHALL be testable without external dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a persistence layer with database connectivity, so that data can be stored and retrieved reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL establish a database connection using configuration
2. WHEN repository methods are called THEN they SHALL use prepared statements and proper transaction handling
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate domain errors
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN database connections SHALL be closed gracefully
5. IF database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL be applied automatically on startup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management, so that the application can be configured for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables with sensible defaults
2. WHEN required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL be validated before use
4. WHEN running in different environments THEN configuration SHALL adapt appropriately
5. IF configuration changes THEN the system SHALL not require code changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support with mocks, so that I can write reliable unit and integration tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN mock implementations SHALL be automatically generated
2. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL use generated mocks for isolation
3. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL execute without external dependencies
4. WHEN interfaces change THEN mocks SHALL be easily regenerated
5. IF test coverage is needed THEN all layers SHALL be testable independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured logging and error handling, so that I can monitor and debug the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL use structured logging with appropriate levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN handling requests THEN correlation IDs SHALL be used for tracing
4. WHEN errors are returned to clients THEN they SHALL not expose internal implementation details
5. IF logging configuration changes THEN it SHALL not require application restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working example domain model, so that I can understand how to implement additional features following the established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is implemented THEN it SHALL include a complete example domain (e.g., User management)
2. WHEN the example is reviewed THEN it SHALL demonstrate all architectural layers working together
3. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL be able to understand the patterns from the example
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the example SHALL serve as a reference implementation
5. IF architectural decisions need justification THEN the example SHALL demonstrate best practices
